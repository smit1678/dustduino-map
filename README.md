# Dustduino-map

Add, track, and visualize air quality sensor data.

## About

The Dustduino-map is a web tool designed to be deployed to track and visualize air quality data generated by arduino-based air quality sensors. The site is based on the dustduino-server backend for managing sensors and data. Users can create new sensors, manage information about existing sensors, and visualize historical data.

Dustduino-map is a part of OpenDustMap and the Dustduino project which connects makers and electronics hackers with civic-minded citizens and journalists to create better data on air quality.

Bug reports, suggestions, and pull requests welcome. See CONTRIBUTING.md.
